Revision history for Perl extension App::Critique

0.05
    - make path display more consistent by always 
      showing it from the root of the git checkout
      even if our working directory is below it
    - allow multi-line commit messages 
        - kinda crappy for now, but works

0.04 13/8/2016
    [BUG FIXES]
    - fixed issue with warnings from Term::ReadKey
        - should also fix the CPANTS errors for
          Win32, where the warning became a
          fatal error
    - tests will now check for a usable git binary
      in the path otherwise BAIL_OUT, which should
      fix the other CPANTS errors

0.03 12/8/2016
    [BUG FIXES]
    - some issues with the dependency list, I was
      missing some, and the version for one had to
      be specified, should fix the CPANTS errors
        - I hope
