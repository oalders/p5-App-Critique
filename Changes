Revision history for Perl extension App::Critique

0.06
  [IMPORTANT CHANGES]
  - Setting CRITIQUE_EDITOR (or EDITOR or VISUAL)
    is now required to run `critique` at all.
    Previously it only errored the first time we
    called the `process` command.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  - Adding better support for the editor option, this
    will do the right thing for three common editors
    (vi, emacs and Sublime Text) and should be able to
    support others if needed.
      - Patches welcome for other editors!
      - Thanks to Sawyer X and Roman Alexeev for this.

    [IMPORTANT CHANGES]
    - the output has changed and so has the workflow
      too much to explain here, but trust me, it is
      better

    [FEATURES]
    - added the `--n` arg to the `collect` command
      which will fork $n processes to collect the
      set of files with violations
        - added interactive "pause" feature for
          when you are *NOT* running under `--n`
    - added `--blame` flag to the `process` command
      to display the git blame stats around the
      violation line
    - adding a `clean` command to check to see if
      any files, which are slated to be fixed,
      have been deleted or not.
    - track the git SHA of HEAD when critique is
      first started
    - added new configuration variables
        - DATA_DIR
            - to specify the name of the directory
              to store the session data in (defaults
              to ".critique")
        - DATA_FILE
            - to specify the name of the file used
              to store the session data in (default
              to "session.json")

    [EXPERIMENTAL]
    - added a Rewriter feature which will attempt to
      re-write a violation if possible
        - this is currently not well documented, but
          should improve in the next few releases

    [CLEANUP]
    - make path display more consistent by always
      showing it from the root of the git checkout
      even if our working directory is below it
    - the `process` command will die unless you have
      an editor set up yet.

    [BUG FIXES]
    - fixed issue with warnings from Term::ReadKey
        - should also fix the CPANTS errors for
          Win32, where the warning became a
          fatal error
    - tests will now check for a usable git binary
      in the path otherwise BAIL_OUT, which should
      fix the other CPANTS errors

0.03 12/8/2016
    [BUG FIXES]
    - some issues with the dependency list, I was
      missing some, and the version for one had to
      be specified, should fix the CPANTS errors
        - I hope

0.02 11/8/2016

    [BUG FIXES]
    - The tests were using `perl` instead of $^X
      and this caused CPANTS failures

    [DOC FIXES]
    - Some wording fixes from Philippe (BooK) Bruhat

0.01 8/8/2016
    - First release to an unsuspecting world
